### Mini History of One of the Most Popular VR Games: Beat Saber

A well-known and very popular VR game is Beat Saber. Beat Saber is a rhythm game where the objective is to slash and cut the beats (small cubes) on beat as they are coming towards the player. Every “beat” has a corresponding color and arrow which indicates which hand the player needs to hit the beat with and what direction to hit the beat in. The goal of this game is to “make the players almost dance while cutting the cubes and avoiding obstacles”. 

The game design is very techno and futuristic with a basic color scheme of blue and red, and sharp glowing lines everywhere. This game includes a good amount of sounds, visual effects, and even haptic feedback. Every slash of a beat includes a sound and visual effect. The blocks will separate in half when they’re hit and the debris will fly past the player. Some find the debris distracting so there is a way to turn it off. The background of the game will also move and light up based on the beat of the song the player is playing. The haptic feedback comes into play when the player slashes a beat, the controller will vibrate. I personally find this feature helpful as it lets me know when I do not hit a beat since my controller did not vibrate. 

Beat Saber is seemingly endless as there are many different options for a player to use. There are different level difficulties which include, easy, normal, hard, expert, and expert+. There are also different modes for each song (if they’re available) including dual saber mode, single saber mode, and 90 degree and 360 modes. The two modes 90 degrees and 360 degrees are special modes where the blocks are not coming from one single direction, but from anywhere in a 90 or 360 degree span of the player.There are also different modifiers for each song to make the gameplay easier or more difficult. Some of these include “Faster Song” and “Slower Song”, which allows the player to make the song faster or slower. Some more are “No Arrows”, “No Bombs”, or “No Obstacles”, which remove these elements from the gameplay to make the song easier to complete. However, based on the modifier, there will either be an increase or decrease in the player’s score depending on if the modifier is meant to make the player’s gameplay easier or harder. Beat Saber is also growing with more features including multiplayer. 

There is very little navigation needed in this game for the average player as they only need to stand facing one direction most of the time, however there is an exception. The 6 degrees of freedom are needed in this game for two reasons. One reason is when the player needs to make excessive movements when playing the 90 degree or 360 modes of a song. Players will need to turn their bodies and heads in a 90 or 360 degrees of motion. Another reason is when players will need to tilt or move their heads in order to avoid obstacles. 

Beat Saber is arguably the most popular and played VR game as it has sold over 4 million copies of it’s release date and 40 million songs from paid music packs. 

I personally believe that I have a strong connection to this game as I have always loved rhythmic games. I was obsessed with Dance Dance Revolution as a kid, and another game called Rhythm Heaven, a Nintendo DS game.
